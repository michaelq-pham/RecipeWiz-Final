# RecipeWiz Final
This project was a fun journey into web development using the Flask framework in conjunction with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal was to create a functional website that seamlessly integrated all the components and generated recipes from beginner friendly to more advanced recipes. One of the initial hurdles we faced was establishing a smooth connection between the backend (Flask) and frontend (HTML, CSS, JS). While the buttons were visible on the front page, getting them to function correctly took more time than anticipated. Uploading our logo presented an unexpected challenge, as it interfered with the website's proper minimization and maximization. This required us to reevaluate our design choices and make tough decisions about prioritizing functionality over aesthetics. After experimenting with the code and weighing the trade-offs, we realized that the effort invested in functionality was more valuable than achieving a perfect design, leading us to proceed with a pragmatic approach. Initially, working with HTML, CSS, and JS seemed daunting, but as we spent more time on the project, our familiarity and comfort with these technologies increased. Learning to use the Flask framework was a significant aspect of this project. Understanding how to structure the backend, route requests, and handle data flow were interesting. Overall it was fun to learn about the Flask framework and to host the website with PythonAnywhere. Importantly we were able to eventually, with lots of valiant effort, set up a virtual environment to connect our Python backend to our frontend with HTML and CSS! We hope the website can be useful to students or anyone who might be stuck pondering on what to make and don't want to spend more time searching the web for recipes just to find out they may not be novice friendly or for those facing the opposite problem, where they want to show of their culinary skills!
